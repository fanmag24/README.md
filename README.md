March 30: I looked through a variety of cs50 pojects through the youtube links provided by the harvard cs50 course. I spent almost the entire class scrolling thorugh countless demo videos that consisted of games, pages with information compiling functions like cookbooks that allows you to enter your own recipe et cetera. These demos slowly combined into one single idea which I later stabilized outside of class.
April 5: I added all the functions onto a google document and labelled all the functions I had to include in my code and started researching. The research happened overthe course of several classes.
April 13: I had gathered most of my reasearch such as how to create and utlize the data table function and refreshed my memory of each block's function and familiarized myself with it so it would be faster for later use.
April 15: I started designing the basic layout of my app. At this point, it focused solely on a private diary with a login and a mood tracker made of sliders. It took serveral classes to completly create a theme and label all elements of the app. I also completed all of my notes for reliable national 24/7 hotline services.
April 23: I completed most of my app's basic design and started the basic code for button and screen transitioning. I also inserted several images and my hotline notes.
April 29: I completed all basic code and continued changing serveral functions. I added a signin function and added error messages so when the user does not or enters a wrong login / signin, a error message will appear to show them that something is wrong.
May 3: Started working storage function. I had look a bit into how exactly I would save previous activities on the iary but it was not very helpful. It took me several nights to figure out the proper code to use for the storage to display where I wanted it to.
May 7:  I completly changed my previous idea of how my storage page would be and made it similar to my diary entry page.
May 11: Finalized all unfinished parts in both code, design and outside resources. I had found several erro due to my significant changes in the past few days so I took a bit of time to make sure everything works smoothly and correctly.
May 13: Finished all code and gathered all materials onto github.
